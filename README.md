Discord server and downloads for the ALBW randomizer: https://discord.gg/dmAJh2uY7M

Up to date logic with randomizer version 0.2.0

## Includes
* Items only mode
* Map with pinnable locations
* Setting toggles for all current preset settings (except unsafe_key_placement, as keys aren't reflected in the tracker)
* Sequence break logic for most skips (Fake Flippers, Desert Palace Skip, Early Ravio Shop, etc.), with the exception of Low% Zaganaga without bow

## Planned
* Google Docs Quick Start/FAQ as documentation
* Update for any changes in the randomizer

## Known issues
* Logic for dungeons where it's possible to have inaccessible chests may not be correct depending on key placement (mainly applies to Eastern Palace)
* Not all combinations of settings produce a completable seed, even if the tracker may say otherwise

## Collaborators
* Thank you DGod63 for the better Bell and Pouch icons, as well as the !
