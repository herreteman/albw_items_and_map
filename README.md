Up to date logic with randomizer version 0.1.3

## Includes

## Planned
* Google Docs Quick Start/FAQ as documentation
* Clean up some location logic with LUA
* Presets/toggles for settings (when that becomes clearer/easier to manage in the rando)
* Update for any changes in the randomizer

## Known issues
* Logic for dungeons where it's possible to have inaccessible chests may not be correct depending on key placement (mainly applies to Eastern Palace)

## Collaborators
