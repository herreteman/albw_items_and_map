# A Link Between Worlds Randomizer tracker pack for EmoTracker

Discord server and downloads for the ALBW randomizer: [add later]

Up to date logic with randomizer version 0.1.0

## Includes
* Items only mode
* Map with pinnable locations
* Sequence break logic for most skips (Fake Flippers, Desert Palace Skip, Early Ravio Shop, etc.), with the exception of Low% Zaganaga

## Planned
* Clean up some location logic with LUA
* Presets/toggles for settings (when that becomes clearer/easier to manage in the rando)
* Update for any changes in the randomizer

## Known issues
* Logic for dungeons where it's possible to have inaccessible chests may not be correct depending on key placement (mainly applies to Eastern Palace)
